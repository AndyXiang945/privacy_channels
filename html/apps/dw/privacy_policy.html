				</ul>
				<p>We log the

					possible external attacks. In addition to this, we evaluate the data
					using statistical analysis. The data kept in the log file are not
					directly linked to users and their identities, and are for internal
					purposes only. They are not passed on to third parties. The data is not
					be used to personally identify visitors to our websites. The data is not
					collated or merged with any other data. The administration of our
					websites using information technology as well as anonymous statistical
					surveys based on data usage allow for a better overall evaluation of the
					data accessed on DW.COM in order to optimize our online offerings (see

				<p>In certain individual cases (for example competitions, newsletters, blogs

				<p><strong>Measurement and analysis tools (in development) <input type="checkbox" id="section5" value="1" style="width: 18px; height: 18px; outline: 2px solid #e90707ef;"></strong></p>
				<p>We employ usage data for statistical purposes and analyses to help us to
					constantly improve and develop our online content. We do not aggregate
					the collected data with other data sources. The data is used for
					internal purposes only and not disclosed to third parties.</p>
				<p> For statistical evaluation purposes,
					we collect information on when and how often the apps are started, used,
					closed and updated. This information is analyzed as individual pieces of
					data and not linked to any other data. No personal data is used during
					the data analysis process. For evaluation purposes, the IP addresses of
					devices that use DW-Apps will be logged; however, this happens
					anonymously.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<!-- <p><strong>Which tools we use and how they work: <input type="checkbox" id="section6" value="1" style="width: 18px; height: 18px; outline: 2px solid #e90707ef;"></strong></p>
				<p><strong>Adjust</strong></p>
				<p>We use the analysis tool provided by
					Adjust GmbH (Saarbrücker Str. 37a, 10405 Berlin, Germany) to measure
					whether our advertisements actually result in our app being downloaded
					and to optimize campaigns.</p>
				<p>Adjust does not store IP addresses
					indefinitely as they only remain in temporary storage for less than 30
					days (GDPR compliant).</p>
				<p>Adjust's Privacy Policy can be found at https://www.adjust.com/privacy-policy/.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Chartbeat </strong></p>
				<p>User data is collected
					by means of cookies in cooperation with Chartbeat Inc. (826 Broadway,
					6th Floor, New York, NY 10003, USA) for real-time evaluation and
					optimization of our content. This service evaluates and processes data
					and IP addresses only on an anonymous basis.</p>
				<p>Anonymized IP
					addresses are used solely for the purpose of geolocation (at city level)
					and for detecting when a session is in progress. After data is processed
					by Chartbeat, DW only receives statistical, aggregated data.</p>
				<p>You
					can learn more about Chartbeat at https://chartbeat.com/about/.
					Chartbeat's Privacy Policy can be found at https://www.chartbeat.com/privacy/.</p>
				<p>Cookies sent by Chartbeat can be stopped at any time by changing the
					settings in your browser.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Fabric</strong></p>
				<p>We use Fabric as an analysis tool to
					improve our online content. Using Fabric, we collect data on the number
					of page views, visits, user behavior, and user retention time.</p>
				<p>In
					order to collect this information, Firebase stores certain personal
					data. We do not aggregate the collected data with other data
					sources.</p>
				<p>This excludes the Crashlytics service provided by
					Fabric, which we use to locate and fix errors, as this service does not
					store full IP addresses.</p>
				<p>For more information, please read the
					privacy policy of Fabric here: https://fabric.io/terms<br>
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Facebook Pixel</strong></p>
				<p>We use Facebook
					pixel to target people who visit DW's website more directly. As is
					common in this industry, we use Facebook Pixel to improve our
					advertisements and to provide people with more relevant ads.</p>
				<p>Facebook pixel is a short piece of JavaScript code that is inserted into
					the HTML code of a web page. When a web page is loaded, Facebook pixel
					sends general information about the browser session to Facebook. If
					possible, a secure HTTP connection is used here. No personal data about
					the visitor to the website is transmitted.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics and Google DFP</strong></p>
				<p>DW uses the web analytics service provider Google Analytics as well as
					the app analytics service Firebase Analytics to improve and further
					develop its content and services in addition to Google DFP which embeds
					relevant advertising.</p>
				<p>These are services provided by Google Inc.
					(Google). Google uses cookies and text files that are stored on your
					computer to analyze your usage of this website. The information
					generated by cookies about your usage of this website (including your IP
					address) is transmitted to and stored on Google servers in the United
					States.</p>
				<p>Your IP address is anonymized while you use this website.
					Google normally truncates IP addresses within member states of the
					European Union as well as the European Economic Area before they are
					communicated to their servers. Only in exceptional cases will your full
					IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.</p>
				<p>Google uses this information to evaluate your use of the website, to
					compile reports on website activity for the operators of the site and to
					provide other services related to website activity and internet usage.
					Google will also transfer this information to third parties if this is
					required by law or if third parties are used to process this data on
					behalf of Google. Third parties, including Google, place ads on websites
					on the Internet, using stored cookies to provide relevant ads based on
					previous visits by a user to this site.</p>
				<p>Google won't associate
					your IP address with other any data. You can prevent the storage of
					cookies by a changing the settings on your browser. We would like to
					point out, however, that in this case you may not be able to fully use
					all features of this website. 
					For more information about disabling Google ads, please visit the
					Disable Google Ads page or refer to the Disable Network Ad Initiative
					page.</p>
				<p>You can withdraw your consent to data collection and
					retention at any time with future effect.
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>AT Internet</strong></p>
				<p>This service is used on
					all DW products as an analysis tool to improve our online content. Using
					AT Internet, we collect data on the number of page views and visits, on
					user behavior and the length of time users spend on our online content.
					This data is gathered anonymously so no personal data is collected. We
					do not aggregate the collected data with other data sources.</p>
				<p>For further information, please read the privacy policy of the service
					provider AT Internet: https://www.atinternet.com/en/company/data-protection/
				</p>
				<p>If you do not agree to the tracking of your visit and want to prevent the
					collection of data by AT Internet, you can switch this off by referring
					to the opt-out procedure of the service provider: https://www.xiti.com/en/optout.aspx</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Internet services and social media integration
						(currently in development)</strong></p>
				<p>Deutsche Welle continues
					to constantly test new services to support internet-friendly ways of
					content distribution, including curating services such as ScribbleLive
					and Storify. We embed our content within social networks such as
					Facebook, Google Plus, Soundcloud, Twitter and YouTube.</p>
				<p>For
					example, we embed content from providers such as YouTube, which is
					stored on their servers, on our websites. If you open a link to such a
					website that features outside content, this provider will receive the IP
					address of the device you use to go online. This external provider
					cannot draw any conclusions about your personal data from this IP
					address alone, but can infer, for example, where you are located
					geographically. Furthermore, this provider can program cookies on your
					device, with which they can log your online behavior.</p>
				<p>Other
					examples are the embedded social network recommendation buttons (also
					called "social plugins") in our content.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Disqus</strong></p>
				<p>Deutsche Welle uses the Disqus commentary
					function. This service is provided by DISQUS, Inc., 301 Howard St, Floor
					3 San Francisco, California-94105, USA. You can find Disqus' data
					protection information here: https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy
				</p>
				<p>Disqus offers various login options. You can either access Disqus using
					your own Disqus account or via existing social media accounts on
					Facebook, Twitter or Google+.</p>
				<p>If you log in to Disqus using a
					social media account, the applicable social media service providers will
					also be able collect and process information about your use of Disqus'
					features. For more information, please see the privacy policy of the
					respective service provider.</p>
				<p>It is possible to comment on DW.COM
					as a guest without logging on to Disqus. However, this means that some
					features may not be available. By signing up with Disqus, you can
					comment on any website that also offers the Disqus comment feature.</p>
				<p>For any commentary made using Disqus, Deutsche Welle will receive the
					following information about the user: the email address you provided and
					the IP address assigned to you by your provider at the time of your
					comment. Deutsche Welle only uses these email addresses when it needs to
					contact you in case of queries regarding your comments. There is no
					other use of the email addresses, nor will they be publicized of shared
					with third parties in any way. The IP addresses are only transmitted to
					prevent any misuse of the comment function. Users that misuse the
					comment function can be blocked using the IP-address.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>ScribbleLive</strong></p>
				<p>For content featuring live blogs or
					a live ticker (for example, Life Links, football tickers and so on)
					DW.COM uses the ScribbleLive service provided by Scribble Inc. (Canada),
					200-488 Wellington St., West Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5V 1E3.</p>
				<p>We embed ScribbleLive, which uses Scribble Inc. servers, on our websites
					and blogs.</p>
				<p>When you visit a page with a live blog or live ticker,
					your browser establishes a direct connection to the server of this
					service provider. Your IP address and other device-related information
					will be transmitted to Scribble Inc. This service provider and its
					potential subcontractors are expressly committed to comply with
					<strong>European data protection laws</strong>. https://www.scribblelive.com/legal/privacy-policy/
				</p>
				<p>The live blog / live ticker page uses temporary cookies stored on your
					hard drive to allow you to access the interactive features of the live
					blog / live ticker.</p>
				<p>DW.COM does not employ any tracking cookies
					when embedding ScribbleLive content.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>promio.net</strong><br> <br> Deutsche Welle uses promio.net to
					send newsletters. promio.net has his own tracking system. By adding some
					parameters to the URLs of the links used in messages, we know when a
					member clicks. And by placing a 1x1 pixel at the end of each message, we
					know if a member opened the message.</p> -->
