				<!-- <label style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">Information that you provide</label>
					<input type="checkbox" id="section1" value="1" style="width: 18px; height: 18px"> -->
				<h4>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION. <input type="checkbox" id="section1" value="1" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; outline: 2px solid #e90707ef;"></h4>
				<h5>Registration Information</h5>
				<p>When you download the App and create an account (“Account”), we may
					collect certain information (“Registration Information”) about you, such
					as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Name;</li>
					<li>Username;</li>
					<li>Email address;</li>
					<li>Cell number;</li>
					<li>Gender identity;</li>
					<li>Date, time, and location of birth;</li>
					<li>Sexual preference;</li>
					<li>Photographs;</li>
					<li>Location; and</li>
					<li>Login information for social media accounts that you connect to your
						Bumble Account.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For Users who are California residents, the data we may collect falls
					within the following categories of “personal information”, as defined by
					the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A. Identifiers, such as name and location;</li>
					<li>B. Personal information, as defined in the California customer
						records law, such as contact (including email and telephone number)
						and financial information;</li>
					<li>C. Characteristics of protected classifications under California or
						federal law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender
						identity, marital status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry,
						national origin, religion, and medical conditions;</li>
					<li>D. Commercial information, such as transaction information and
						purchase history;</li>
					<li>E. Biometric information;</li>
					<li>F. Internet or network activity information, such as browsing
						history and interactions with our Sites and App;</li>
					<li>G. Geolocation data, such as mobile device location;</li>
					<li>H. Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as photos
						and videos;</li>
					<li>I. Professional or employment-related information, such as work
						history and prior employer;</li>
					<li>J. Non-public education information; and</li>
					<li>K. Inferences drawn from any of the personal information listed
						above to create a profile or summary about, for example, an
						individual’s preferences and characteristics.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Profile Information</h5>
				<p>When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function to
					communicate with other Users, the amount of personal information you
					share is at your own risk. Please see Section 4 below for more
					information on who can access what you post on Bumble.</p>
				<h5>Profile Verification Information (Including Biometric Information)</h5>
				<p>For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user
					experience, we require Users to verify their accounts and might ask for
					your phone number and, in some instances, we might also ask that you
					carry out photo verification. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we
					also want to avoid fake Bumble accounts being created which can be used
					for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Bumble
					network and spoil things for everyone. This verification might be
					required by us for the prevention of fraud. You can also verify your
					photo on a voluntary basis (to add the blue ‘verified’ badge to your
					profile).</p>
				<p>If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo that
					you submit. The scan may include the use of facial recognition
					technology so that we can compare the photo you submit to your profile
					photo, to help ensure that you are who you say you are. We do not add
					the verification photos to your profile. We retain the scans so that we
					can verify you in the future and for our record-keeping purposes until
					we no longer need them for such purposes or for three years after your
					last interaction with us, whichever occurs first. After the applicable
					retention period expires, we take commercially reasonable steps to
					permanently and securely delete the scans from our systems.</p>
				<h5>Purchases Information</h5>
				<p>If you decide to purchase any of our
					premium services, we will process your payment information and retain
					this securely for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax
					purposes.</p>
				<p>Bumble uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent payment
					transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud procedures. In
					order to do this, our systems check payment transactions for behavior
					that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If a
					transaction meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and
					Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached and the transaction
					is likely to be fraudulent, the relevant transaction may automatically
					be blocked. Where a transaction is blocked, the user will be notified
					that their transaction cannot be processed and affected Users can
					contact Bumble to contest the decision.</p>
				<p>Please note that if your account is blocked for any reason, any
					account(s) that you have on other Bumble Group platforms/applications,
					such as Badoo, may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and
					anti-fraud procedures.</p>
				<h5>Geolocation Information</h5>
				<p>If you have given Bumble access to your location in your device settings,
					when you use your cell, we will collect information about WiFi access
					points as well as other location information about your longitude and
					latitude and may save your device’s coordinates to offer certain
					features to you. This information helps us identify your physical
					location and we use it to personalize the App and make it easier for you
					to interact with other Users, by enabling the general locality
					information to be displayed to Users seeing your profile and showing you
					the profiles of other Users who are near you.</p>
				<p>If you have given Bumble access to your location, but wish to turn this
					off, you can do so by the following methods:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Bumble</li>
					<li>Android — settings, location, Bumble, permissions, location</li>
				</ol>
				<h5>Device and Photos Information</h5>
				<p>We may collect information about your device when you use the App
					including the unique device identifier, device model, and operating
					system, for a number of purposes, as set out in this policy. In
					addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may access your device’s
					address book solely in order to add someone to your contacts.</p>
				<p>We also collect data about your photos, such as which are the photos that
					users spend time on or which are the photos that have the best lighting,
					etc. We may use that data to rearrange your profile photos aiming to
					position them in a way that is favorable to you. You may opt-out of this
					feature through our app settings.</p>
				<h5>Links</h5>
				<p>We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Bumble
					including third party services by redirecting clicks or through other
					means. We may share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a
					particular link was clicked on.</p>
				<h5>Messages</h5>
				<p>We review the content of messages sent in the App to identify topics,
					sentiments, and trends across our Users. We will take steps to remove
					personally identifying information from such messages, prior to
					reviewing them. We will not share the content of User messages or
					information we derive from them with any third party.</p>
				<h5>Bumble Success Stories, Surveys and other Contributions</h5>
				<p>From time to time, we run surveys for research purposes and we may
					contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also
					contact you to find out if you would like to provide feedback, a
					testimonial or take part in marketing campaigns (for example, if you let
					us know that you have found a match on the App, we may contact you to
					ask if you would be happy to feature in advertising for Bumble).
				</p>
				<h5>When you Contact Customer Support</h5>
				<p>If you contact our Customer Support team via our Feedback
						Page, we will
					receive your email address, and may track your IP address, as well as
					the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep
					records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we
					receive from you about other Users (and from other Users about you) for
					6 years after deletion of your account.</p>
				<h4>2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION. <input type="checkbox" id="section2" value="1" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; outline: 2px solid #e90707ef;"></h4>
				<p>Our main goal is to ensure your experience on Bumble is an enjoyable one
					and you don’t end up getting stung! In order to deliver an enjoyable
					experience to you, we may use your Registration and other information
					to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>offer you our services and features;</li>
					<li>contact you with information about the App (e.g., updates and new
						features);</li>
					<li>personalize the App/Sites and the content we deliver to you;</li>
					<li>conduct research and analytics about how you use and interact with
						the App/Sites;</li>
					<li>to test new technologies and processes designed to enhance and
						improve the App/Sites;</li>
					<li>resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and to enforce our Terms
						&amp; Conditions;</li>
					<li>investigate fraud, protect our legal rights, and to enforce our
						Terms &amp; Conditions.</li>
					<li>to send you information about the promotions and offers we have
						available. We will not use your information in email
						direct marketing unless you give us your consent (you can withdraw from
						marketing at any time via Settings in the App or by using the
						opt-out mechanisms and links provided in each message); and</li>
					<li>protect our Users and third parties from harm.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Our Matching Algorithms</h5>
				<p> We use the following
					data about you and other users to predict your compatibility with others
					and generate profile recommendations: <b>the information you provide us
						about yourself</b> in your profile such as age, distance or gender
					so we can show you people who are appropriate and are more likely to
					like you back; <b>information about how you interact with our app</b> to
					suggest to you people who are active and available to meet new people;
					<b>and your device coordinates</b>, which are necessary to understand
					your proximity to other members. 
				</p>
				<h5>Moderation Practices</h5>
				<p>We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to
					monitor and review accounts (including photos and any other information
					uploaded onto user profiles) and messages for content that indicates
					breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. </p>
				<h5>Lawful Basis</h5>
				<p>Under EU and UK data protection laws, we are required to tell you our
					lawful basis for using your data and we have set this out in the table
					below. Where the legal basis is consent, you can withdraw consent at any
					time. Where the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a right to
					object to our use of your data. We explain in the relevant sections in
					this Policy how you can withdraw consent or opt-out of certain data uses
					(where applicable).</p>

				<h5>Service Providers</h5>
				<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to
					perform functions and provide services to us (“Service Providers”). The
					suppliers with which Bumble shares User personal data vary depending on
					a variety of factors, such as which of our App, Sites and services a
					User engages with. For example, to provide our services to Users, we
					typically use the following suppliers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Billing services</li>

				<h4>4. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS. <input type="checkbox" id="section4" value="1" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; outline: 2px solid #e90707ef;"></h4>
				<p>For Users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in
					addition to those listed at section 10 below) under the California
					Consumer Privacy Act, and you have the right to be free from unlawful
					discrimination for exercising your rights under the Act:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information
						to you and explain how we have collected, used and shared your
						personal information over the past 12 months.</li>
					<li>You have the right to request that we delete your personal
						information that we collected from you, subject to certain
						exceptions.</li>
				</ol>
				<p> At this time, we do not track our Users’
					personal information over time and across third-party online services.
					We do not knowingly permit third parties to
					collect personal information about an individual User’s online
					activities over time and across different online services when using the
					App.</p>
				<h4>5. YOUR RIGHTS. <input type="checkbox" id="section5" value="1" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; outline: 2px solid #e90707ef;"></h4>
				<p>Privacy laws applicable in your country may give you the following
					rights:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Right to be informed: what personal data an organization is
						processing and why (we provide this information to you in this
						Privacy Policy).</li>
					<li>Right of access: you can request a copy of your data.</li>
					<li>Right of rectification: if the data held is inaccurate, you have the
						right to have it corrected.</li>
					<li>Right to erasure: you have the right to have your data deleted in
						certain circumstances.</li>
					<li>Right to restrict processing: in limited circumstances, you have the
						right to request that processing is stopped but the data
						retained.</li>
					<li>Right to data portability: you can request a copy of certain data in
						a machine-readable form that can be transferred to another
						provider.</li>
					<li>Right to object: in certain circumstances (including where data is
						processed on the basis of legitimate interests or for the purposes
						of marketing) you may object to that processing.</li>
					<li>Rights related to automated decision-making including profiling:
						there are several rights in this area where processing carried out
						on a solely automated basis results in a decision which has legal or
						significant effects for the individual. In these circumstances your
						rights include the right to ensure that there is human intervention
						in the decision-making process.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If you want to exercise any of your rights listed above please visit our
					Feedback Page or email our
					Data Protection Officer at DPO@bumble.com You can also
					contact us by post at the following address: The Broadgate Tower Third
					Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS. For your

					before we can answer the above requests.
				</p>
				<p>If you have a concern about how we have processed your request or your
					personal data, you should contact us in the first instance via the
					contact details listed above.</p>
				<p>If you feel we have not resolved
					your concern, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the
					Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues.
					If you live in a country or territory located in the European Union (EU)
					or European Economic Area (EEA), you may also get in touch with your

				<h4>6. DATA LOCATIONS. <input type="checkbox" id="section6" value="1" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; outline: 2px solid #e90707ef;"></h4>
				<p>We want you to be able to access Bumble
					wherever you happen to be in the world. To enable us to provide that
					service, we operate a global network of servers including in the US, UK,
					EU, and (for Users located in Russia) Russia. The hardware is located in
					third-party data centers but is owned by the Bumble Group. Data
					collected by Advertising Partners and other Service Providers may also
					be held outside the UK and the European Economic Area. We ensure that
					the data is adequately protected by ensuring that valid, legal
					mechanisms are in place such as: EU approved model clauses, and implementing robust contractual
					standards. If you want more information relating to the nature of the
					safeguards we have in place, please email DPO@bumble.com.</p>
				<h4>7. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION. <input type="checkbox" id="section7" value="1" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; outline: 2px solid #e90707ef;"></h4>
				<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the
					legal basis relied upon (as set out in Section 2 above) and as permitted
					by applicable law. Please see “Profile Verification Information
					(Including Biometric Information)” in Section 1, above, to learn about
					our retention policy with respect to biometric information.</p>
				<p>When your Account is deleted, we make sure it is no longer viewable in
					the App. For up to 28 days, it is still possible to restore your Account
					if it was accidentally deleted. After 28 days, we begin the process of
					deleting your personal information from our systems, unless:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you
						make purchases within the App, some personal data may be kept for
						tax and accounting purposes);</li>
					<li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for
						example, if an account is blocked, we keep some account information
						and a record of the behavior that led to the block - this
						information is retained for evidential purposes in case of queries
						or legal claims concerning the block);</li>
					<li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep
						the relevant information until it is resolved; or</li>
					<li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests,
						such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users’ safety and security
						(for example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who
						was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a
						new account).</li>
