<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Informed Consent Form</b></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">(Approved by the Human Subjects Team in Our University)</h4>
<br>
<b>PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH:</b>
<br> 
This study aims to explore Android users’ understanding of mobile app’s privacy practices after 
interacting with three privacy transparency channels on Google Play Store. 
In this study, three transparency channels will be provided one at a time on this website; 
you will be asked to interact with them, read the information carefully, and answer some related questions. 
Only anonymized data is collected in this study.
 Collected data might be used in the future by researchers from our university. 
<br>
<br> 

<b> EXPLANATION OF PROCEDURES/METHODS TO BE USED:</b>
<br>
You will take on the role of a mobile app user looking to install a new app from the Google Play Store. 
You'll be presented with an interface that displays app information, 
closely mimicking the typical experience of browsing and installing an app from the Google Play Store. 
You will be guided through the app’s fundamentals and will be asked to answer a few preliminary questions before our main study. 
In the main study, you'll engage with three different privacy transparency channels of the app, one at a time. Following each interaction, 
you will be asked to share your understanding of the privacy transparency of the app and indicate if you have any concerns. 
After completing three rounds of interactions, you will answer some other questions about your overall impression and experience in this study.

<br>
<br>
It takes around 50 minutes to complete the study.
<br>
<br>
We only compensate workers who complete the entire study, 
including completing the three interactions and answering all the questions. 
You should see your confirmation page that you completed the entire study with your Prolific ID after the demographic questions. 
We will use your Prolific ID to compensate you if you completed the entire study with high quality responses. 
We will review your answers to check their quality.
<br>
<br>
